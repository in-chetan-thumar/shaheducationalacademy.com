Finance is a core stone of any economy. I qualified as a Chartered Accountant about 35 years ago, and since then there have been major reforms in the Indian economic, educational and job scenario. The world is developing fast and one has to develop faster to maintain pace with the growing economy. All you need is right knowledge which comes with right choice of specialized course. Since past 27 years of teaching commerce students, our aim has been to not only provide high quality education, but a step further, to make them achieve milestones in their career. We identify your potential and enable you to realize it to the fullest. We offer coaching in courses not only at Junior College Level, but also at Graduate [B.Com, BAF, BMS, BFM], Post Graduate [M.Com, MBA entrance tests] and Professional Level [CA, CS, CFA, CFP]. Despite having a growing student base, we have maintained smaller batch size for effective delivery of lectures. Apart from the regular batches, we also offer tutorial sessions, revision lectures, test series, crash courses as fast-track coaching options. We boast of a highly experienced team of faculty who use innovative pedagogy of learning and lay emphasis on fundamentals. Our study material is tailor made, easy to understand and self sufficient in all respects to cater to the requirements of the students. Our lectures are well-structured and we assure timely completion of syllabus. Besides, a half yearly progress review is conducted to assess the performance of the students and timely counseling is provided wherever required for improvement. SEA is well known for training aspiring professionals, producing toppers over the years. It is our constant endeavor to deliver the best to our students so that they fly sky high in pursuit of excellence.? In short, we are a one stop destination for any and every course in the FINANCE faculty!!! I wish you all the best for your career!! Prof. Sharad Shah Dean, SEA
